          After working at IT Yall, I decided to pivot into a more advanced role and ended up working at my Alma Mater who was looking for someone with my level of curiosity.
          
          My job requirements include: 
          - Designing, testing, and implementing solutions for server-side issues
          - Writing complex SQL queries to modify test and production tables
          - Ensuring the smooth running of back-end PHP web scripts, and fix bugs when they appear

          Upon graduating from LeTourneau University, I had the opportunity to work at IT Yall to get myself started in the industry. While my primary work was help-desk related, I built a C# application to automate our computer tune-up process that saved the company 15 minutes per end user. 
          
          Some of my accomplishments while working there include:
          - Lead developer of their proprietary PC tune-up software
          - Set up wired networks for end-user locations
          - Wrote batch scripts to automate repeatable work such as the new computer onboarding process

          After working at Brookshire's, I moved on to work at the Home Depot in Paris Texas because it was closer to Paris Junior College, where I was attending business classes. After graduating at PJC in May 2017, I transferred to the location in Longview Texas so that I could financially support myself while attending LeTourneau University.
          While here my responsibilities included:
          - Recieving payments for transactions
          - Lifting heavy objects into vehicles if no lot loader was available
          - Meeting the credit card sale quota weekly

          My job responsibilities included: 
           - Taking groceries to outside vehicles
           - Cleaning messes and spills to prevent slips and falls
           - Maintaining front end orderliness
          After a few months of being a courtesy clerk, I got promoted to a Cashier.
